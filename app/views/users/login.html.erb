                    This consent form is part of an informed consent process for a research study and it will provide information 
                    that will help you decide whether you want to take part in this study.  It is your choice to take part or not. 
                    After all of your questions have been answered and you wish to take part in the research study, you will be 
                    asked to sign this consent form by entering your provided alphanumeric code. You will be given a copy of the 
                    signed form to keep. Your alternative to taking part in the research is not to take part in it.

                <b>Who is conducting this research study and what is it about?</b>
                <br>
                <div class="container-text">
                    You are being asked to take part in research conducted by Dr. John Collins, Temitope Ali, Dr. Laryssa Patti, 
                    and Dr. Jonathan McCoy. Dr. Collins is the principal investigator, and he, Dr. Patti and Dr. McCoy are
                    attending physicians in the Department of Emergency Medicine at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School in
                    New Brunswick, New Jersey. Temitope Ali is also a co-investigator and is a Rutgers Alumni. The purpose of this
                    study is to observe the effect of a novel survey format on participant responses to an online survey. Questions 
                    from the survey itself are based on another study where the primary goal is to collect data for admission
                    decisions for Emergency Department patients. Because of this, the data you provide may also help improve
                    knowledge about hospital admission decision making. We anticipate 259 subjects will take part in the study.
                </div>
                <br>
                <b>What will I be asked to do if I take part?</b>
                <br>
                <div class="container-text">
                    The survey will take about 10 minutes to complete. You will be asked to answer survey questions after reading 
                    a brief clinical vignette about five clinical scenarios. 
                </div>
                <br>
                <b>What are the risks and/or discomforts I might experience if I take part in the study?</b>
                <br>
                <div class="container-text">
                    Risks are minimal but include loss of confidentiality. Breach of confidentiality is a risk of harm, but a 
                    data security plan is in place to minimize such a risk. No identifying information is being collected about 
                    study subjects. Also, some questions may make you feel uncomfortable. If that happens, you can leave that 
                    question unanswered or withdraw from the study altogether. 
                </div>
                <br>
                <b>Are there any benefits to me if I choose to take part in this study?</b>
                <br>
                <div class="container-text">
                    There are no direct benefits to you for taking part in this research. You will be contributing to knowledge 
                    about survey design methods, while also providing information that may help inform the Department of Emergency 
                    Medicine (EM), Department of Family Medicine and Community Health (FM), Department of Medicine (IM), and the 
                    Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine (PCC) hospital admission decisions by identifying patterns 
                    and differences in hospital admission decision making.

                    We will use a survey website (https://medicometrics.herokuapp.com/) created for this study to collect your
                    responses to survey questions. No identifying information (name, IP address, email address, etc.) will be 
                    collected. We will ask you for non-identifying demographical information (gender, age, department, role, years
                    worked) at the start of this survey. Your responses will be assigned and stored as a randomly generated 
                    alphanumeric code so others will not know which responses are yours. All survey response data downloaded from 
                    the website will be stored on a password-protected online storage site called OneDrive administered by the 
                    Office of Information Technology at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School. Our goal is to publish our 
                    results in a peer-reviewed journal, however there will be no information to identify you or any participant. 
                    No information that can identify you will appear in any professional presentation or publication.

                    Responses to survey questions will be stored for analysis. After the study is over, we plan to publish our 
                    results in a peer-reviewed journal. No information that can identify you will appear in any professional

                    Your participation is voluntary. If you choose to take part now, you may change your mind and withdraw later.
